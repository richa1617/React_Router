//useMemo is based on the Memoization concept, which  is an optimization technique used primarily to speed up computer programs by storing the results of expensive function calls and returning the cached result when again with the same parameters. 


//And here we use the useMemo hook by caching the isEven value so that way if its value did not change we don't have to re-run our slow function over and over again
